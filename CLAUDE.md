# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is "Northern Script" („ÅÆ„Éº„Åñ„Çì„Åô„Åè„Çä„Å∑„Å®), a Japanese VitePress documentation site focused on programming, AI, and writing tools. The site primarily documents PRH (proofreader) installation and configuration for Japanese technical writing.

## Architecture

- **Static Site Generator**: VitePress (Vue-powered documentation framework)
- **Theme**: Catppuccin theme (@catppuccin/vitepress)
- **Content**: Japanese markdown documentation with focus on PRH setup guides
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - only VitePress, Catppuccin theme, and gray-matter for frontmatter parsing

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run docs:dev

# Build for production  
npm run docs:build

# Preview production build
npm run docs:preview
```

## Content Structure

- `index.md` - Homepage with hero section and feature links
- `prh-install.md` - Main PRH installation guide for VS Code
- `prh-install2.md` - Technical writing rules installation guide
- `assets/prh-install/` - Screenshots and images for installation guides
- `public/` - Static assets

## Key Content Focus

The site documents Japanese technical writing tools:
- PRH (proofreader) VS Code extension setup
- prh.yml configuration files for Japanese text correction
- TechBooster writing rules integration
- Markdown-specific exclusion patterns for PRH

## File Structure Notes

- VitePress uses file-based routing (`.md` files become pages)
- Assets are referenced relatively from markdown files
- Japanese content with technical English terms mixed in
- Frontmatter configuration controls navigation and page metadata

## Current Project: Amazon Associates Book Recommendations

### Project Status (As of 2025-07-29)

The site now includes an English-language Amazon Associates affiliate section for Japanese mystery novels translated into English. This section is targeted at English-speaking readers interested in Japanese literature.

### Key Files to Update When Adding New Books

1. **Navigation** (`.vitepress/config.mts`): Add new book to sidebar
2. **Amazon Config** (`.vitepress/amazon-config.js`): Add book metadata
3. **Overview Page** (`/en/books/mystery-novels.md`): Add book to main list
4. **Individual Page**: Create new markdown file in `/en/books/mystery-novels/`

### Amazon Image Collection Process

When adding new books, collect proper Amazon product images:
1. Visit Amazon product page via affiliate link
2. Right-click on book cover ‚Üí "Copy Image Address" 
3. Verify URL pattern: `https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/[ID]._SL1500_.jpg`
4. Test URL in browser before adding to code
5. Update both individual page and amazon-config.js

### Important Notes for Continuation

- All content should be English-only (not Japanese)
- Maintain personal perspective as Japanese reader
- Include cultural context and insights
- Keep Amazon Associates compliance
- Use consistent CTA placement and styling
- Test all affiliate links before publishing

### Cross-Reference Update Strategy

When adding new books, update the "If You Enjoyed This..." sections to prioritize same-author recommendations:

**Current Author Groupings:**
- **Keigo Higashino**: The Devotion of Suspect X, Malice, Journey Under the Midnight Sun
- **Other authors**: Individual books (will be grouped as more are added)

**Update Rules:**
1. **Same Author Priority**: Always recommend other books by the same author first
2. **Similar Themes**: Second priority for books with similar psychological/mystery themes
3. **Existing Pages Only**: Never link to non-existent pages
4. **Bidirectional Links**: When adding a new book, update existing books to reference it

**Example Update Process:**
- When adding another Keigo Higashino book, update all 3 existing Higashino pages
- When adding first book by a new author, update 1-2 most similar existing books
- When adding second book by that author, create author-based groupings

**Future Author Groups to Watch For:**
- **Miyuki Miyabe**: Puppet Master (planned) + future additions
- **Soji Shimada**: Tokyo Zodiac Murders (planned) + future additions  
- **Yukito Ayatsuji**: Decagon House Murders (planned) + future additions
- **Hideo Yokoyama**: Six Four (planned) + future additions
