## My Personal Take

I first encountered „ÄéÂç†ÊòüË°ìÊÆ∫‰∫∫‰∫ã‰ª∂„Äèas a university student in the 1980s, right after its original publication rocked the Japanese mystery world. This was the book that convinced me that Japanese authors could not only match but surpass the great puzzle mysteries of the Golden Age. Even now, decades later, I can still remember the exact moment I realized the solution‚Äîand the way it completely recontextualized everything I thought I knew about impossible crimes.

What Shimada accomplished here was nothing short of revolutionary. He took the seemingly exhausted format of the locked-room mystery and breathed new life into it by combining mathematical precision with psychological insight. This isn't just a puzzle to be solved; it's a meditation on the nature of perception, reality, and the stories we tell ourselves about both.

## What Makes This Special

### The Impossible Crime That Started a Movement

The central mystery is audaciously simple and impossibly complex: a man is found dead in a locked room, surrounded by his daughter and nieces who have been arranged according to astrological signs. The room was observed from outside, and there's no way for the killer to have escaped. Yet somehow, the impossible happened.

What makes this different from other locked-room mysteries is Shimada's approach to the solution. Rather than relying on mechanical tricks or obscure poisons, he delves into the psychology of perception itself. The "trick" is as much about how we process information as it is about physical impossibility. It's the kind of solution that makes you want to immediately reread the book to see all the clues you missed.

### Cultural Context That Matters

**The Honkaku Tradition**: This novel revitalized the "honkaku" (Êú¨Ê†º) tradition of fair-play mysteries in Japan. After decades of social mysteries and hard-boiled imports, Shimada reminded Japanese readers why puzzle mysteries could be both intellectually satisfying and emotionally resonant. The book launched what became known as the "shin honkaku" (new orthodox) movement.

**Astrology as Structure**: The use of astrological signs isn't mere window dressing‚Äîit reflects a particularly Japanese approach to systematic thinking. In Japanese culture, we have a strong tradition of finding patterns and meaning in seemingly disparate elements. Shimada uses this cultural inclination to create a puzzle that feels both foreign and familiar to Japanese readers.

**The Detective as Outsider**: Kiyoshi Mitarai, the detective, is an astronomer‚Äîa scientist who deals with celestial mechanics, not earthly crimes. This reflects a Japanese fascination with the relationship between theoretical knowledge and practical application. His approach to crime-solving mirrors the methodical observation required for astronomical research.

## The Solution's Genius

Without spoiling the specific mechanics, I can say that the solution operates on multiple levels simultaneously. It's:

- **Physically possible**: Everything can be explained through concrete actions
- **Psychologically sound**: The perpetrator's motivations make sense
- **Logically elegant**: The method follows naturally from the established constraints
- **Thematically appropriate**: The solution reflects the book's concerns with perception and reality

What struck me most was how the solution reframed not just the crime, but the entire narrative. Shimada doesn't just answer "how was it done?"‚Äîhe transforms our understanding of what actually happened. It's the literary equivalent of those optical illusions where you suddenly see the hidden image.

## The Translation Achievement

Ross and Shika MacKenzie face enormous challenges in translating this work. The novel depends heavily on visual elements‚Äîdiagrams, floor plans, and precise spatial relationships‚Äîthat must be preserved exactly for the puzzle to work. They succeed admirably, maintaining both the technical precision required for the mystery and the atmospheric elements that make it more than just a logic exercise.

Some of the cultural references inevitably get simplified‚Äîthe specific connotations of certain astrological beliefs in Japan, for instance‚Äîbut the core mystery remains intact and solvable for English readers.

## Why This Matters for Mystery Fiction

This novel proved that the puzzle mystery wasn't a relic of the 1930s but a living form capable of evolution. Shimada showed how impossible crimes could be both intellectually rigorous and emotionally resonant. He demonstrated that Japanese authors could contribute original ideas to a genre often dominated by British and American voices.

The influence is still felt today. You can trace a direct line from this novel to the current renaissance of Japanese mystery fiction in translation. Without Shimada's proof that honkaku mysteries could find international audiences, we might never have discovered authors like Keigo Higashino or Yukito Ayatsuji.

## Reading Notes for Puzzle Enthusiasts

- **Play fair**: All clues are present and observable. Don't overthink the supernatural elements‚Äîthey're red herrings.
- **Pay attention to spatial relationships**: The diagrams aren't decorative. Study them carefully.
- **Consider multiple timeframes**: The solution involves understanding when things happened as much as how.
- **Think like an astronomer**: Mitarai's profession isn't coincidental. His method of observation is key.

## Comparing to Golden Age Masters

This holds up remarkably well against classics like John Dickson Carr's locked-room mysteries or Ellery Queen's logical puzzles. What Shimada adds is a distinctly Japanese sensibility‚Äîthe attention to psychological nuance, the integration of traditional and modern elements, and the willingness to make the solution both simpler and more complex than expected.

If you enjoyed the puzzles of Clayton Rawson or the impossible crimes of Paul Halter, this will feel both familiar and refreshingly different.

## Final Verdict

„ÄéÂç†ÊòüË°ìÊÆ∫‰∫∫‰∫ã‰ª∂„Äèis essential reading for anyone serious about mystery fiction. It's not just a great Japanese mystery‚Äîit's a great mystery, period. The solution is fair, brilliant, and completely satisfying. The characters are more than puzzle pieces, and the atmosphere is genuinely eerie without relying on supernatural elements.

More importantly, it's the book that proved Japanese mystery writers could innovate within classical forms while bringing their own cultural perspectives to bear. It opened doors for an entire generation of authors and helped establish the current golden age of Japanese mystery fiction in translation.

For puzzle enthusiasts, it's a must-read that will remind you why you fell in love with impossible crimes in the first place. For general mystery readers, it's an accessible entry point into Japanese detective fiction that doesn't require extensive cultural knowledge to enjoy.

Just be prepared: once you know the solution, you'll never look at locked-room mysteries quite the same way again.
