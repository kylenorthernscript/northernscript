## Japan's Lowest Mountain - Mt. Tenpo

Right next to the aquarium is **Mt. Tenpo (Tenpozan)**, officially recognized as one of the lowest mountains in Japan—standing only about **4.5 meters (15 feet) tall**. It may sound like a joke, but you can say you "climbed a mountain in Japan"! There's even a summit sign for your victory photo. It's a quick and fun detour that makes for a great travel story.

## The Scenic Ferry Adventure

*Scenic harbor views during the ferry ride*
After your "hike," consider taking a local ferry across the river from **Tenpozan Pier**. This **free ferry**, called the **Shuttle Boat** or **"Watasen"**, carries pedestrians across the port and gives you great views of the harbor.

### Getting to Universal Studios Japan

On the other side, you'll be closer to **Universal Studios Japan (USJ)**. However, please note that from the ferry landing, you'll need to walk about **1 kilometer (about 0.6 miles)** to reach **Sakurajima Station**, the nearest train stop to USJ's entrance. It's a flat and easy walk, and it makes for a unique, scenic way to approach the park—away from the crowds.
