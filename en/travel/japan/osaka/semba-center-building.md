## What Makes It Special

This is not your average shopping mall. It's a **1-kilometer-long building** that stretches beneath an elevated highway, running through the heart of Osaka's old textile district. Built in the 1960s, the structure combines a fascinating retro-futuristic design with rows of textile wholesalers, shops, and local businesses. It's like walking through a time capsule of Osaka's economic growth era.

## Hidden Underground Dining Scene

But here's the best part for visitors:

Below the building, especially in **buildings 7 through 10**, you'll discover a thriving underground dining scene that's **completely off the tourist radar**. This maze of basement restaurants and bars is where **local office workers, textile merchants, and neighborhood residents** gather for affordable meals and after-work drinks.

### What You'll Find Underground

- **Authentic izakayas** where salarymen unwind with cheap beer and homestyle cooking
- **Family-run sushi counters** serving fresh fish at fraction of downtown prices  
- **Local ramen shops** with recipes passed down through generations
- **Curry specialists** popular with the working crowd
- **Traditional cafes** that have barely changed since the 1970s
- **Hidden bars** known only to regulars

The atmosphere is genuinely local—**no English menus, no tourist markup**, just honest food at honest prices. Most places have been serving the same community for decades, creating an authentic dining experience you simply can't find in commercial tourist areas.

## Why Visit

## How to Get There

Just head downstairs from one of the entrances on **Sakaisuji Avenue** or walk from **Honmachi Station**—it's all connected underground.

### Dining Tips for the Underground Scene

- **Peak hours (12:00-13:00, 18:00-20:00)**: When the area comes alive with local workers
