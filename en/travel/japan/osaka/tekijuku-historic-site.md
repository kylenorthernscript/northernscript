## A Revolutionary School in Closed Japan

Founded in **1838**, Tekijuku was a private school for Western studies, especially Dutch medicine and science, at a time when Japan was still closed off to the rest of the world. The school was run by **Ogata Koan**, a pioneering doctor and scholar who helped introduce Western medical knowledge to Japan.


Many of Tekijuku's students went on to become key figures in the modernization of Japan—including **Fukuzawa Yukichi**, one of the founders of Keio University and a major intellectual figure whose face appears on the 10,000 yen bill.

## Step Back in Time

The building itself is a beautifully preserved traditional Edo-period townhouse, and stepping inside feels like going back in time. You can see the original classroom, study spaces, and even the doctor's examination room.

The exhibits are simple but meaningful, showing how revolutionary the ideas taught here were in their time.

## Historical Significance

### What Made Tekijuku Special

- **First Western medical school** in Japan during the isolation period
- **Training ground for modernizers** who shaped Japan's future

### The Dutch Connection

During Japan's isolation period (1633-1853), the Dutch were the only Western nation allowed to trade with Japan. This unique relationship made Dutch the language of Western learning, and Tekijuku became the premier institution for "Dutch Learning" (Rangaku).
